Handwritten digit recognition is a machine learning project using the MNIST dataset. Neural networks are employed to detect scanned images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). During training, the model learns from labeled data, adjusting its parameters to minimize errors. The system predicts the digit label with the highest probability. Advanced techniques like CNNs are often used for better performance. Applications include form processing and digitizing historical documents.
